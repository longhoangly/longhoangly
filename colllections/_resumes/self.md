A QA engineer who is living and working in Ho Chi Minh city. I love coding, testing and making sure products released with the best quality.

I have been testing software products in various types such as E2E test on websites or mobile applications, and API test.

I can perform manual tests as well as writing automation test scripts. If you want to cooperate with me or any question to me, feel free to drop me an email.
