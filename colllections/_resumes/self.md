A QA engineer who is living and working in Ho Chi Minh city. I love coding, testing and making sure products released with the best quality.

I have been testing software products in various types such as websites, mobile, API applications.

I can perform manual tests as well as write automation test scripts, run performance tests, and write tool to support for manual testing. If you want to cooperate with me or any question to me, feel free to drop me an email.
