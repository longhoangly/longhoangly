Hello! Iâ€™m Long Ly and I'm a software engineer in test from Ho Chi Minh city.
To me, value is the most important thing when we live our life or work in a community,
I always want to work and contribute to the software advancetage via open source projects.
Given that my contribution is small, but together we can make it. Keep it up and do right things.

### Latest Work

  - Tech Stacks / Tools: Angular (TypeScript), Spring (Java), Google Clouds, Github, Web (HTML, CSS, JS)

  - In order to import flashcards generated by AnkiFlash, users need to install [_an importer add-on_](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1129289384 "AnkiFlash Importer") in Anki. This importer add-on was written in Python.
