### Latest Work

- AnkiFlash

  - A _free tool_ (<a href="https://ankiflash.com/" target="_blank">_https://ankiflash.com/_</a>) to generate **Anki flashcards** for learning vocabularies in multiple languages such as **_Vietnamese, English, Japanese, French, Chinese_**.

  - Tech Stacks / Tools: Angular (TypeScript), Spring (Java), Google Clouds, Github, Web (HTML, CSS, JS)

  - In order to import flashcards generated by AnkiFlash, users need to install <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1129289384" target="_blank">_an importer add-on_</a> in Anki. This importer add-on was written in Python.

  - The site have around 900 users around the world who learn different languages. A lot of flashcards created to help users learning vocabularies. If you want to study vocabularies with Anki and AnkiFlash, here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/5dABxn_dWaI" target="_blank">_instruction video._</a>
